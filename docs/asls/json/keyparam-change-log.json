  "description": "Key Param Change Record. The keyparam.change.record type is designed for straightforward logging of important parameter changes in the SCADA and AtomicTNode code for transactive space-heating systems. Check out the details in [gridworks-atn]( https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks-atn) and [gw-scada-spaceheat-python](https://github.com/thegridelectric/gw-scada-spaceheat-python). It's made for humans—developers and system maintainers—to easily create and reference records of significant changes. Keep it short and sweet. We suggest using a "Before" and "After" attribute pattern to include the changed value, focusing for example on specific components rather than the entire hardware layout.",
