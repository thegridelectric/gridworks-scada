"""
GridWorks Enums used in scada, the Application Shared Language (ASL) used by SCADA
devices and AtomicTNodes to communicate with each other. These enums play a specific structural
role as semantic "glue" within ASLs.

Application Shared Languages are an evolution of the concept of Application Programming Interfaces.
In a nutshell, an API can be viewed as a rather restricted version of an SAL, where only one application
has anything complex/interesting to say and, in general, the developers/owners of that application
have sole responsibility for managing the versioning and changing of that API. Note also that SALs
do not make any a priori assumption about the relationship (i.e. the default client/server for an API)
or the message delivery mechanism (i.e. via default GET/POST to RESTful URLs). For more information
on these ideas:
