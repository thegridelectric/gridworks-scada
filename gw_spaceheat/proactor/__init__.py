"""This packages provides infrastructure for running a proactor on top of asyncio with support multiple MQTT clients
and and sub-objects which support their own threads for synchronous operations.

This packages is not GridWorks-aware (except that it links actors with multiple mqtt clients). This separation between
communication / action infrastructure and GridWorks semantics is intended to allow the latter to be more focussed.

This package is not polished and the separation is up for debate.

Particular questions:
* Is the programming model still clean after more concrete actors are implemented and more infrastructure are added.
* Does the separation add value or just complicate analysis.
* MQTTClients should be made async.
* Semantics of building message type namespaces should be spelled out / further worked out.
* Test support should be implemented / cleaner.
